		<p>I was born in the North Suburbs of Chicago.  Grew up with 3 siblings.  We were all very competive and grew up playing sports.  I graduated from the University of Illinois and ended up moving back to Chicago to work.  I moved to Jersey City last summer with my fiance. Currently working in sales but taking this class to change careers and become a Web Developer</p>
